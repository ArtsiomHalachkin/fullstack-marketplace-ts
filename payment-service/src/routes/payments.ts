/* DEPRECATED: routes/payments.ts

  This file has been intentionally left as a no-op placeholder.
  Routes for the Payment service are registered inline in `src/api/server.ts`
  to follow the same pattern used by other services in this monorepo
  (controller methods bound directly on the server).

  If you need to re-enable a router-based approach, replace this file
  with the appropriate Route definitions and import it from the server.
